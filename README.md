# DataStructureApplication

This is a learning application illustrating Android development best practices with Android Jetpack.

Note that some changes (such as database schema modifications) are not backwards
compatible during this alpha period and may cause the app to crash. In this
case, please uninstall and re-install the app.

Introduction
------------

Android Jetpack is a set of components, tools and guidance to make great Android apps. They bring
together the existing Support Library and Architecture Components and arranges them into four
categories:

Libraries Used
--------------
* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [AppCompat][1] - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [LiveData][13] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Navigation][14] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
  * [Room][16] - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [WorkManager][18] - Manage your Android background jobs.
* [UI][30] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate
  * [Animations & Transitions][31] - Move widgets and transition between screens.
  * [Fragment][34] - A basic unit of composable UI.
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
* Third party
  * [Glide][90] for image loading
